            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a band director turned software engineer. I taught music in public schools for a few years and realized my passion for web development was greater than my love of teaching. So, over the past couple of years I have taught myself a skill set that would be beneficial to a Javascript front end development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now looking for a welcoming team of more experienced developers where I can make meaningful contributions and take my coding skills to the next level.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                These are the things I like to do most
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hang out with my family</li>
                <li>Eat delicious food</li>
                <li>Play board games (I got a 3D printed Catan Board for Christmas)</li>
                <li>Write code!</li>
            </ul>
